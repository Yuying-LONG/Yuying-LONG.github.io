abstract: 'It is difficult to dispatch heterogeneous relief resources efficiently and fairly in dynamic post-disaster response, because there are a large number of heterogeneous relief resources with different types, and functions that need to be satisfied simultaneously and collaboratively. To address this, we propose a dynamic heterogeneous relief resource dispatching approach for efficient and fair post-disaster response. Specifically, this paper analyzes the measurement of dispatching efficiency and fairness. With the objective of maximizing efficiency and fairness, we present an integer programming model for the heterogeneous relief resources dispatching problem. Secondly, a dynamic heterogeneous relief resources dispatching approach is proposed based on the rolling horizon framework and the proposed model, thus achieving dynamic relief resources dispatching. Thirdly, this paper verifies the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic heterogeneous relief resources dispatching approach through numerical experiments. Then potential factors that affect dispatching fairness are investigated. Finally, corresponding management suggestions are put forward for practical operation and management of dynamic heterogeneous relief resources dispatching in post-disaster response. Results show that the proposed dynamic heterogeneous relief resources dispatching approach can achieve efficient and fair post-disaster response. The research results can provide efficient dynamic decision-making methods and corresponding managerial insights for practical post-disaster relief resource dispatching operations.'
