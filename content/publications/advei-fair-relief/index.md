abstract: Efficient and fair resource allocation is essential in post-disaster relief operations to save lives and mitigate losses. However, due to the highly dynamic and uncertain relief supplies and rescue demands, as well as the complex interdependent relationships among heterogeneous relief resources, the practice of relief resource allocation frequently suffers from low efficiency or unfairness, thus delaying the response activities or even causing social tensions. To address these problems, this paper investigates the heterogeneous relief resource allocation problem and develops a dynamic solution method for efficient and fair allocations. Specifically, a heterogeneous resource allocation model is built to maximize efficiency considering the tight collaboration among resources. A Gini-based fairness evaluation metric is proposed for assessing allocation fairness, and an analysis of the balance between fairness and efficiency is conducted. Then, a dynamic resource allocation method is designed based on the rolling horizon framework, with an Adaptive Dynamic REsource Allocation Method (A-DREAM) developed to balance allocation fairness and efficiency in dynamic scenarios. The performance of the proposed method is verified through systematic experimental case studies, and potential factors affecting allocation fairness are investigated. Finally, the managerial implications for practical relief operations are also derived through sensitivity analysis.
