<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>
I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree in Aviation Engineering from [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/aae/), where I am so fortunate to be supervised by [Dr. Gangyan XU](http://xugangyan.cn/index.html). I received a B.S. in traffic and transportation from Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China, and an M.E. degree in transportation engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen), Shenzhen, China, in 2020 and 2022, respectively.

My research interests include **UAV-assisted systems**, **emergency management**, and **emergency logistics**.
